> > DevStack's mission is to provide and maintain tools used for the installation of the central OpenStack services from source (git repository master, or specific branches) suitable for development and operational testing. It also demonstrates and documents examples of configuring and running services as well as command line client usage. [DevStack](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/DevStack)

> With some technical skills, DevStack is a great option to install and run an OpenStack cloud on your laptop (or even inside the VM on a cloud). DevStack is ideal for potential users who want to see what the Dashboard looks like from an admin or user perspective, and OpenStack contributors wanting to test against a complete local environment.

> DevStack is a series of extensible scripts used to quickly bring up a complete OpenStack environment. It is used interactively as a development environment and as the basis for much of the OpenStack projectâ€™s functional testing. [Homepage](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/)
