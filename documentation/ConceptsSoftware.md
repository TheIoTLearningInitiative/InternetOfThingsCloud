# Front & Back End

> In software engineering, front end and back end distinguish between the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (the front end) - which is the interface between the user - and the data access layer (the back end). The front and back ends may be distributed among one or more systems. In software architecture, there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. Each can be spoken of as having a front end and a back end. The front is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface.

# Load Balancing

> In computing, load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.
