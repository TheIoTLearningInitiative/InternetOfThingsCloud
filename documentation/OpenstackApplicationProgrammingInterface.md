# Application Programming Interface

> Use the OpenStack APIs and extensions to launch server instances, create images, assign metadata to instances and images, create containers and objects, and complete other actions in your OpenStack cloud. [OpenStack API Complete Reference](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html)

> Although you install each OpenStack service separately, the OpenStack services work together to meet your cloud needs: Identity, Compute, Images, Block Storage, Networking (neutron), Object Storage, Databases, and Metering. With the TryStack OpenStack installation, these services work together in the background of the installation. [OpenStack API Guide](http://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/)
