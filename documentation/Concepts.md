# Concepts

# Front & Back End

> In software engineering, front end and back end distinguish between the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (the front end) - which is the interface between the user - and the data access layer (the back end). The front and back ends may be distributed among one or more systems. In software architecture, there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. Each can be spoken of as having a front end and a back end. The front is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface. []()

# Virtualization

> In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer network resources. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)

# Hypervisors

> A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine; and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)
