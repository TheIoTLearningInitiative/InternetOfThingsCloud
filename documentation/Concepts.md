# Stubs

> A stub is a small program routine that substitutes for a longer program, possibly to be loaded later or that is located remotely. For example, a program that uses Remote Procedure Calls ( RPC ) is compiled with stubs that substitute for the program that provides a requested procedure. [Whatis](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/stub)

 
> A method stub or simply stub in software development is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality. A stub may simulate the behavior of existing code (such as a procedure on a remote machine) or be a temporary substitute for yet-to-be-developed code. Stubs are therefore most useful in porting, distributed computing as well as general software development and testing.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub)

# Virtual LAN

> A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation of local area network. To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures a network switch or router. [Virtual LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)

# Compute Cluster

> A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster)
