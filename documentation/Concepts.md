> A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine; and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)
