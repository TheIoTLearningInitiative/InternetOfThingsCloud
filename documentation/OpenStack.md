> Open source software for creating private and public clouds

> OpenStack is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The software platform consists of interrelated components that control hardware pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. Users either manage it through a web-based dashboard, through command-line tools, or through a RESTful API. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack)

## History

> OpenStack was created during the first months of 2010. Rackspace wanted to rewrite the infrastructure code running its Cloud servers offering, and considered open sourcing the existing Cloud files code. At the same time, Anso Labs (contracting for NASA) had published beta code for Nova, a Python-based “cloud computing fabric controller”. Both efforts converged and formed the base for OpenStack [Openstack Introduction: A Bit of OpenStack History](http://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/introduction.html)
