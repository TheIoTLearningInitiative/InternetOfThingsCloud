# Redundant Power Supply

> Redundant power is a critical component in high availability systems. In the simplest solution, two power supplies can drive a load through diodes to OR their outputs together. In this way, the power supplies can either share the load or have one active and the other in standby. [Redundant power techniques for servers explained](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1273185)

# Compute Cluster

> A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster)

# High Availability Cluster

> High-availability clusters (also known as HA clusters or fail-over clusters) are groups of computers that support server applications that can be reliably utilized with a minimum of down-time. They operate by using high availability software to harness redundant computers in groups or clusters that provide continued service when system components fail. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster)

# Elastic Computing

> In cloud computing, elasticity is defined as "the degree to which a system is able to adapt to workload changes by provisioning and de-provisioning resources in an autonomic manner, such that at each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(cloud_computing)

# Virtual LAN

> A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation of local area network. To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures a network switch or router. [Virtual LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)

# Load Balancing

> In computing, load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.
