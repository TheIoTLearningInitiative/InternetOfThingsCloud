# Compute Cluster

> A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster)

# High Availability Cluster

> High-availability clusters (also known as HA clusters or fail-over clusters) are groups of computers that support server applications that can be reliably utilized with a minimum of down-time. They operate by using high availability software to harness redundant computers in groups or clusters that provide continued service when system components fail. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster)

# Virtual LAN

> A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation of local area network. To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures a network switch or router. [Virtual LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)
