# Virtualization

> In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, operating systems, storage devices, and computer network resources. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)

Way To Virtualize:

- Client Virtualization Software
- Hypervisor

## Client Virtualization Software

> In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a particular computer system. Virtual machines operate based on the computer architecture and functions of a real or hypothetical computer, and their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)

- VirtualBox

## Hypervisors

> A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine; and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)

### Kernel Virtual Machine

> VM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.
