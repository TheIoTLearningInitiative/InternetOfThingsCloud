# Top 500 The List

> The TOP500 project was launched in 1993 to improve and renew the Mannheim supercomputer statistics, which had been in use for seven years. Our simple TOP500 approach does not define “supercomputer” as such, but we use a benchmark to rank systems and to decide on whether or not they qualify for the TOP500 list. The benchmark we decided on was Linpack, which means that systems are ranked only by their ability to solve a set of linear equations, A x = b, using a dense random matrix A. Therefore, any supercomputer – no matter what its architecture is – can make it into the TOP500 list, as long as it is able to solve a set of linear equations using floating point arithmetic.
